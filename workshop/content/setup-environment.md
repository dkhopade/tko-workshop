We are going to use Tanzu Mission control to build, manage lifecycle and backup Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers. We will then implement policies that will help provide self-service role based access to developers, secure container runtime, forward metrics to Tanzu Observability and implement Secure communications on application services running on top of these clusters using Tanzu Service Mesh.

# SaaS Services
**Important**: For the next sections, it is vital that you  make sure to sign-in to cloud.vmware.com with your **@vmware.com** email address and select the **Tanzu End to End** organization.  Please be careful not to alter the services or configurations of the clusters in these environments as they are shared for the entire End to End Demo Environment.

Click below to sign in.  If you can't see this organization, you can self-enroll into the organization at https://via.vmware.com/tanzu-e2e-demo

## Workload Cluster kubeconfig

You will need a kubeconfig from the `gke-psp-demo` cluster if you wish to validate the policies set in Tanzu Mission Control.  To fetch a kubeconfig:

- Go to the the Tanzu Mission Control tab, locate the cluster `gke-psp-demo` under the clusters page and click on it.

- Click Actions from the top right hand side of the page and click **Access This Cluster**

- Click on **view YAML** and copy the YAML config (there is a small "copy" button that will copy the entire text)

- Click **OK** button to dismiss the window.

- Go to the **Workshop** tab and open a new editor by clicking the text below:
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/kubeconfig-gke-psp-demo.yaml
text: |
```
- Once the empty file appears, paste the contents of the kubeconfig copied from the previous steps.

- Once pasted, make sure to hit `ctrl+s` to save the file.

- Login to TMC using the CLI:
```execute
tmc login
```

- In Tanzu Mission Control, fetch an API Token by clicking on the dropdown of your username in the top right hand corner, click **My Account**, click on the **API tokens** tab, click on **Generate a new API Token**. If you need to re-issue an existing token, click on **REGENERATE** to create a new one and and copy the generated token then, click **Continue**.

- Go back to the Workshop page, on the **Terminal** tab

- When Prompted to provide the API Token, paste the API token you just copied. Give a context name like `tmc-tko` and `aws-hosted` for **Management Cluster Name** and `aws` for **Provisioner Name**, like shown in the below snapshot.
